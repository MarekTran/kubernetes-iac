# PyInfra IaC playground project

This project is a playground for trying out Infrastructure as Code (IaC) concepts in a local Proxmox VM environment.

Notes:
- Since this is just for learning, the IP addreses are in my local subnet. If I wanted to have a local kubernetes cluster, I would create a subnet on Proxmox. 
- This repo just serves as a practice before I make a real deployment to my Always Free Oracle Cloud node cluster.
